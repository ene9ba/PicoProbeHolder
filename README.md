# Pico Probe Adapter

Debuging the Raspberry Pi Pico by using the Pico as a Probe is a great thing, but by using a breadborard as interface to the
target is a little bit anoying. So I decided to design a PICO Probe pcb to make it easier to debug software without any contact 
and connection problems. A Resetbutton, as well as two jumpers to supply the target with 3.3V or 5V are integrated.
